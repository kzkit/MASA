# Future Plans
### Analysis of data collected in the server
The collected data will further be analysed using AI technologies to come up with better results. Besides, it can be used for activity charting and statistic over a certain period and also in pattern profiling and alert notifications.

### System Extension
* Empty home alert - The elderly has left home
* Arrived home alert - the elderly has arrived home
* Prolonged Dwelling Alerts
* Prolonged empty home alert - the elderly has not arrived home until a configurable timing
* No activity alert - The elderly has not moved for a configurable period of time
* Location based alert â€“ Display the current location of band wearer
